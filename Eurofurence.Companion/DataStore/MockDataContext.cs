If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nSign in for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, ##:00-##:00 and on Thursday, ##:##-##:##. It will be at the main registration desk.\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nWednesday, ##:00-##:00, Main registration desk Thursday, ##:##-##:00, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, ##:##-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""12:00:00"",""EndTime"":""14:30:00"",""Duration"":""02:30:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""7e3dad60-fee6-4ab8-b1be-a99655ec4218"",""PanelHosts"":""Atkelar"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""135c768f-cf4c-41e0-8ea1-ed2560e89df2"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-18T21:10:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""1001"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""photographers_round_table"",""Title"":""Photographers' Round Table"",""SubTitle"":"""",""ConferenceTrackId"":""735738c1-76c2-476a-830c-64df716f7982"",""Abstract"":""Come in and join some fellow photographers in discussions about equipment, lighting, framing and image composition.\r\nFeel free to bring along some examples of your work and don't forget your camera.

So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This Lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini-Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini-Lounge in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth Fursuit Lounges are Fursuiters-Only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or End of Dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini-Lounge near the lobby is open round the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days !\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the Con, the Lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the Lounges begins.

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP&CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit-Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This Lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini-Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini-Lounge in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth Fursuit Lounges are Fursuiters-Only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or End of Dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini-Lounge near the lobby is open round the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days !\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the Con, the Lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the Lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead-Dog Dance, the main lounge will operate with reduced equipment."",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3d567-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""21:00:00"",""EndTime"":""03:00:00"",""Duration"":""06:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""3e70f7b1-250b-40d1-a4bb-172094db35c0"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-07-15T13:50:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""1058"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""dead_dog_party"",""Title"":""Dead Dog Party"",""SubTitle"":"""",""ConferenceTrackId"":""e64d4e82-eeb9-4e06-9c41-9fa15af748d0"",""Abstract"":""Once more, another Eurofurence is over.

If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nSign in for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, ##:00-##:00 and on Thursday, ##:##-##:##.

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP&CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit-Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is located near the main stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This Lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini-Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini-Lounge in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth Fursuit Lounges are Fursuiters-Only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or End of Dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini-Lounge near the lobby is open round the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days !\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the Con, the Lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the Lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead-Dog Dance, the main lounge will operate with reduced equipment."",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""21:00:00"",""EndTime"":""05:00:00"",""Duration"":""08:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""744dfdbb-5c95-420f-8130-fe4022edb876"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-07-15T15:20:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""1033"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""drawing_with_ritka"",""Title"":""Drawing with Ritka!

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS.

There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play!

A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth Fursuit Lounges are Fursuiters-Only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or End of Dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe main Fursuit-Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini-Lounge near the lobby is open round the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days !\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the Con, the Lounge opens at 09:00.

Drawing these can be a pain, though, and many artists refuse to do so or even add fees for wings on characters. Why is that? Mostly because wings are thought to be complicated constructs attached to an anthro's back and people don't like to draw wings! But birds are awesome. And wings are awesome, too. \r\n\r\nWolfgryph will lead you through the basics of bird anatomy, wing anatomy, wing types and feathers with scientific knowledge and drawing experience. Basics in different shapes of beaks, wings and tails will be part of the presentation as well as live drawing to demonstrate how the artist approaches to draw the discussed. \r\n\r\nIf you like, you shall be encouraged to bring along your pencils, drawing pads, sketchbooks or a sheet of paper and practice drawing during the presentation.

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""09:00:00"",""EndTime"":""15:00:00"",""Duration"":""06:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""fae1b5b6-24b0-44f2-a445-91c33399d34c"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-07-15T14:10:02Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""948"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""dealers_den_artist_setup_fri"",""Title"":""Dealers' Den "",""SubTitle"":""Artist Setup"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""9f1f1e8a-6ae7-46fb-8db1-4bb4fc1d2400"",""Abstract"":""In the Dealers' Den artists and dealers from all over the world sell all kind of furry related art, prints, sketches, books, comics, t-shirts and all different kind of merchandise.

The Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n  - Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n  - Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n  - The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n  - Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n  - Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n**Important new rule!**\r\n\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit. You do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.
