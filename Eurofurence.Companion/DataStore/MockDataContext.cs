So finding your theme for in your musical piece in a lot of (but mostly orchestral) styles and genre is for me one of the most important part.\r\n \r\nWe will anaylize and go through some work from music of from John Powell (\u201eHow tot rain your dragon\u201c) to Thomas bergerson (Two Steps from Hell) to Gareth Coker (\u201eOri and the blind forest\u201c). \r\n \r\nIf time \u2013 we develop our own music theme and find ways to make variations of it.\r\n \r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MkzeOmkOUHM\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JNhA8qyykkk\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=izsjRpcgfmk&index=14&list=PL7_8KJvbYl3QZ9UWdyYA6ByWXsu0M9TjS\r\n"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""14:00:00"",""EndTime"":""15:30:00"",""Duration"":""01:30:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""e13ecbed-9123-4c82-ae65-08316ee43037"",""PanelHosts"":""CoVaHr"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""3aa3dd67-6ca4-4013-8423-8746060ad4fa"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-13T19:40:02Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""1002"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""krita_change_digital_painting"",""Title"":""Krita: The app that will change digital painting forever"",""SubTitle"":"""",""ConferenceTrackId"":""70df7880-80d3-4ee6-96f7-2db70dff7d04"",""Abstract"":""Krita is the powerful digital painting application for Concept Artists, Digital Painters, and Illustrators with professional features and a quickly growing user base including industry artists.

And the best part is: it's Open Source, which means that anyone can contribute to its development, and also that it comes free of charge! Krita is perfect for the needs of furry artists, ranging from the hobbyist to the professional.\r\n \r\nIn this panel, we would like to provide both a basic introduction for those who are new to Krita as well as a more in depth look with a live demo.

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""21:00:00"",""EndTime"":""05:00:00"",""Duration"":""08:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""79c3fbaa-bda7-4a40-bbc9-28b48465a96e"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-12T11:20:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""991"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""fureoke_1"",""Title"":""Fureoke"",""SubTitle"":"""",""ConferenceTrackId"":""c926dfae-56b4-43cb-ae15-bf83df885b3c"",""Abstract"":""Let out your inner animal and howl along to classic songs in all genres!

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""09:00:00"",""EndTime"":""21:00:00"",""Duration"":""12:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""986b8246-fcad-4a5a-a766-13f6e75bad2c"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-07T20:10:02Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""941"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""art_show_closing"",""Title"":""Art Show Closing"",""SubTitle"":"""",""ConferenceTrackId"":""8af3638e-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""Abstract"":""This year's Art Show again presents a multitude of international artists.

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge.

And while there are a ton of\r\nmass-produced plushies available, having a plushie of your own fursona is something very\r\nspecial. This panel will teach you how to make your own plushies. While we will have a\r\nshort look at how to sew, the main focus of this panel is the creation of the pattern for\r\nthe plushie.\r\n\r\nWe will have a look at a special method of pattern generation which relies on the creation\r\nof a digital 3d model. Using digital tools has the advantage, that you can try out\r\ndifferent designs and - like in digital drawing - you can just undo mistakes. Don't let\r\nthe words \""digital 3d model\"" scare you - you need neither experience in 3d modeling nor\r\nsewing to make use of what you will learn in this panel.\r\n\r\nAfter this panel you will know everything you need to get started making plushies."",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3e817-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""16:00:00"",""EndTime"":""17:30:00"",""Duration"":""01:30:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""e13ecbed-9123-4c82-ae65-08316ee43037"",""PanelHosts"":""Fenmar"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""f13e8762-e978-4854-bbd8-571fcdcf80fe"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-06T21:20:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""933"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""artist_lounge_sun_2"",""Title"":""Artists' Lounge "",""SubTitle"":""Let's be creative together!"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""39218c14-2450-4266-8668-cde4d2878669"",""Abstract"":""Do you like spending your evening around other artists, drawing and chatting about techniques?

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf"",""StartTime"":""10:00:00"",""EndTime"":""15:00:00"",""Duration"":""05:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""12d4b6d0-ee46-47e3-b58a-995a61d0b1ff"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur"",""IsDeviatingFromConBook"":""0""},{""Id"":""fae1b5b6-24b0-44f2-a445-91c33399d34c"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-06-07T20:30:01Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""948"",""ImageId"":null,""Slug"":""dealers_den_artist_setup_fri"",""Title"":""Dealers' Den "",""SubTitle"":""Artist Setup"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""9f1f1e8a-6ae7-46fb-8db1-4bb4fc1d2400"",""Abstract"":""We are proud to open the doors again this year at a very new location, in a new room, with more artists and dealers \u2013 both known faces and new members \u2013 presenting their art and merchandise to you.

Given the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\n\r\n**Location:** Start (and end) is in the Fursuit lounge (Convention Hall  - Section C)\\\\\r\n**Time:** Friday at 4:30pm"",""Position"":""0"",""ImageId"":null},{""Id"":""35743b44-586d-42c0-9def-f4f7d1029708"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-03-27T14:59:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""InfoGroupId"":""c520424f-8408-4c01-bb28-3b4b3ea1871a"",""Title"":""Artists Alley"",""Text"":""Several years ago, still at the Ringberg Hotel in Suhl, we introduced the Artist Alley because the Dealers' Den had become too small. The Maritim in Magdeburg offered us more space for the Dealers' Den, so we dropped the Artist Alley in favor of two separate Dealers' Den rooms, which still wasn't ideal. When the Den team saw the room in the Estrel for the first time it was like a dream came true \u00e2\u20ac\u201c space! But reality hit hard when we realized that not only the amount of attendees kept growing, but also the number of dealers. Sadly we still didn't have enough space to give every applying artist or dealer a proper selling place.\r\n\r\nSo we were looking for further space to grow once more. Luckily we didn't have to look very far. That's why we can proudly announce that the Artist Alley is back at Eurofurence! You will find it right in front of the Dealers' Den.\r\n\r\nThe Alley is meant to be a place for artists who want to sell their sketches, prints, and merchandise during the regular Den opening hours.

The Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n  - Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n  - Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n  - The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n  - Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n  - Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n**Important new rule!**\r\n\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit. You do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.
