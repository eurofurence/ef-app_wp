If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are four mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 12:30-13:30 and 14:00-15:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nSign in for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 19:00-21:00 and on Thursday, 13:30-16:00. It will be at the main registration desk.\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit.

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel.

Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?

If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are four mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 12:30-13:30 and 14:00-15:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time!

Nobody knows these days. But the animals that were left behind on Earth - along with some genetic experiments - started a new civilization. In order to keep it \""civilized\"", there are annual games where players can compete against each other in a non-violent way.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are four mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\n## Registration ##\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 12:30-13:30 and 14:00-15:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time!

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""55c85946-c46f-11e5-af20-00155d17ae4a"",""StartTime"":""21:00:00"",""EndTime"":""05:00:00"",""Duration"":""08:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""269dedb3-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur""},{""Id"":""3b11b35c-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-02-03T17:40:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""751"",""Slug"":""fursuit_photo_fursuit_friendly_dance"",""Title"":""Fursuit Group Photo + Fursuit Friendly Dance \u2013 Fursuit Friendly Dance"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""00db2160-c2c5-11e5-855c-00155d17ae4a"",""Abstract"":""Help us create the largest (European) fursuit picture ever!

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""55c89542-c46f-11e5-af20-00155d17ae4a"",""StartTime"":""09:00:00"",""EndTime"":""16:30:00"",""Duration"":""07:30:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""269dedb3-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur""},{""Id"":""3b12a6d6-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-02-03T17:40:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""822"",""Slug"":""charity_poker_intro"",""Title"":""Charity Poker Intro Panel"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""00dc9e16-c2c5-11e5-855c-00155d17ae4a"",""Abstract"":""For the beginners and novices, this panel will review the basics of playing no-limit Texas Hold'em poker!

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location).

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""55c8d06f-c46f-11e5-af20-00155d17ae4a"",""StartTime"":""09:00:00"",""EndTime"":""21:00:00"",""Duration"":""12:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""269dedb3-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur""},{""Id"":""3b1ce6d7-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-02-03T17:40:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""725"",""Slug"":""artist_lounge_sat_1"",""Title"":""Artists' Lounge \u2013 Let's be creative together!"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""e6ea7350-c2c9-11e5-855c-00155d17ae4a"",""Abstract"":""Do you like spending your evening around other artists, drawing and chatting about techniques?

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs.\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic.\r\nTo make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n-  Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n \r\n#### NEW: The little Oasis ####\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if  you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Lounge Opening Hours ####\r\n09:00 - End of Dance\r\nThe Fursuit Lounge is open every convention day, from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last Event, including Sunday. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security over the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in.\r\nThe little oasis is open round the clock.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Days ! ####\r\nOn Early-Arrival Day, the Lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Dead-Dog, we're as well open from 09:00 until the end of the Dead-Dog Dance.\r\nPlease remove all your belongings from the Fursuit Lounge after this.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Parade ####\r\nDon't miss out when the entire furry tribe gathers for their annual march through the overgrown ruins of ancient societies ,  and assembles near the old canal to capture the moment in full color pictures.\r\nThe Eurofurence Parade is traditionally an outdoor event, if the weather permits. Due to the layout of the hotel, our current parade route unfortunately will include a couple of stairs. Should you be unable to use stairs in fursuit, please check the parade posters hanging in the lobby to find the wheelchair friendly parts of the route.\r\nGiven the sheer number of almost 1000 registered fursuiters, the parade will take more than one hour, including the photo stop near the canal.\r\nWhen?    16:30 Encouraged gathering time: 15 minutes earlier\r\nWhere?   The parade starts and ends in the Fursuit Lounge.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### Fursuit Badge  Pick-up and Printing ####\r\nIf you are a fursuiter, you most likely pre-registered for your free Fursuit Badge. The Badge station to pick them up is located right next to Registration, where you can pick them up during service hours. If you forgot to pre-register your badge in time, we can also produce your personal Fursuit Badge on site. Your first Badge is free. For extra badges, we need to charge you a small fee of 2 Euro per Badge.\r\n\r\n#### Important new rule! ####\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit.\r\nYou do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits.\r\nPlease present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nService Hours:\r\nTuesday:        11:00-19:00 (pre-reg pickup only!)\r\nWednesday:      11:00-17:00\r\nThurday:        11:00-13:00 and 16:00-18:00\r\nFriday:         11:00-13:00\r\nSaturday:       12:00-13:00"",""ConferenceDayId"":""55c8d06f-c46f-11e5-af20-00155d17ae4a"",""StartTime"":""21:00:00"",""EndTime"":""05:00:00"",""Duration"":""08:00:00"",""ConferenceRoomId"":""269dedb3-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""PanelHosts"":""Mystifur""},{""Id"":""3b2347bd-ca9d-11e5-a256-00155d17ae4a"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-02-03T17:40:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""SourceEventId"":""737"",""Slug"":""big_blue_dance"",""Title"":""Big Blue Dance"",""ConferenceTrackId"":""00db4849-c2c5-11e5-855c-00155d17ae4a"",""Abstract"":""Like last year, a lot of talented DJs are going to tear up the dancefloor on the main stage and in the bar.

From artificial storms to beverages that glow in the dark. From Emergency surgery to fur fumigation. Our all-purpose anthro lounge caters to all your needs. The Fursuit Lounge is a Fursuiters-Only area, intended to offer them a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the Fursuiters' stay in the Fursuit Lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n  - Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the Fursuit Lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n  - Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n  - The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n  - Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n  - Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n**Important new rule!**\r\n\r\nYou will need a personal fursuit badge to enter the Fursuit-Louge. It is your access key out of suit. You do not need more than one badge, even if you have several suits. Please present your Fursuithead upon pick-up, so we know you really are a suiter :)\r\n\r\nOpening times: daily from 9am til 30 minutes after the last event\r\n\r\n**NEW: The little Oasis**\\\\\r\nWe realise that with the growing con and location, the main Fursuit Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel. To help you survive, we have installed 'The Little Oasis' in the Estrel Saal Foyer, near the Lobby. (Last years lounge location). A small location with viewing protection and fresh water round the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down."",""Position"":""1"",""ImageId"":null},{""Id"":""b2444073-3d07-451b-a529-778ecd6e0ba7"",""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"":""2016-03-27T14:59:35Z"",""IsDeleted"":""0"",""InfoGroupId"":""c520424f-8408-4c01-bb28-3b4b3ea1871a"",""Title"":""Eurofurence on Social Media"",""Text"":""You have a great time with old and new friends?
