Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage"",    ""Duration"": ""01:00:00"",    ""StartTime"": ""18:30:00"",    ""EndTime"": ""19:30:00"",    ""PanelHosts"": ""Atkelar"",    ""IsDeviatingFromConBook"": false,    ""Id"": ""f9e35063-00f9-4168-86eb-257b72481c70"",    ""LastChangeDateTimeUtc"": ""2017-02-22T13:45:30.88Z""  },  {    ""Slug"": ""kage_open_mic"",    ""Title"": ""Open microphone"",    ""SubTitle"": """",    ""Abstract"": ""Have you ever wanted to try out stand-up comedy?

If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\""How are the teams selected?\"", and \""Can I participate?\"" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit.

That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit.

So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it.

You should also gather here for the parade.

Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00.

You should also gather here for the parade.

Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins.

There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00.

They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event.

In fact, I thought, as many people do, that wolves were vicious and would attack humans. Then I started my research and found out that not only did wolves not attack humans, they had very complex social structures that are very similar to human social structures. I also learned about the theory of wolf-human coevolution, the idea that wolves, and later dogs influenced our evolution and we theirs, and that they may have helped make us the dominant species on the planet.

Kaala struggles to be accepted into her pack, and as soon as she makes progress, she saves the life of a human child, breaking one of the most important wolf laws—to stay away from the humans. Risking expulsion from their pack and banishment from the Wide Valley, Kaala and her young packmates begin to hunt with the humans and thus discover the long-hidden bond between the two clans.

Fighting to save the last of an endangered species, it is not only a worthy charity, but also one that desperately needs all the help we can give it.\n\nYou may already know the African wild dog, also known as the painted dog (Lycaon pictus). These beautiful hunting dogs (which are actually not dogs at all, but a completely different species) have splotched fur patterns and big round ears. What most people do not know is that the painted dog is sadly also one of the most endangered species of Africa, with fewer dogs left on the whole continent than there are furries at Anthrocon!\n\nSadly, myths and misunderstandings have given them a bad reputation, causing them to be persecuted by humans. Many more are killed on the road, get caught in snares set by poachers to get bushmeat, or catch diseases from domestic dogs. Their numbers have dwindled from 500.000 to less than 7000 over the past century.\n\nThe Painted Dog Conservation is devoted to the protection of the wild dogs and is active in Zimbabwe, where the local population of dogs is one of the last strongholds of the species. Their conservation methods help both the dogs and the local human population in a lasting way, making the future outlook of the species brighter.\n\nThough the Painted Dog Conservation's work is very successful, there are sadly still many setbacks. As recent as last November, elephant poachers have put cyanide in the wildlife's drinking water, killing an entire pack of 9 dogs and their 11 pups.

As a condition of membership, all Eurofurence attendees are required to abide by these rules of conduct for the entire duration of their stay, even prior to opening or after closing of the convention. When in doubt about any of these rules, please ask - we will gladly answer all your questions. However, please understand that we will not debate these rules with you during the convention. The rules of conduct will be strictly enforced by Eurofurence security volunteers who will be clearly identified as such on site. If you have any problem with any action taken by a Staff member you may take the matter up with the Chief of Security or the Chairman.\n\n\n\n**GENERAL RULES**\n\nAny action or behavior that causes significant interference with convention operations, excessive discomfort to other attendees, or adversely affects Eurofurence's relationship with its guests, its venues or the public is strictly forbidden and may result in permanent suspension of membership. This general rule supersedes all others listed below and may be invoked at any time.\n  * Please treat each other respectfully.\n  * You are liable for any damage you might cause.\n  * Always follow the directions by convention staff and security.\n  * Harassment of any kind, including physical assault, battery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome physical attentions, will not be tolerated.\n  * Please be aware that the lobby, the foyers and the restaurants are public areas, and that there may be regular hotel guests around who are not taking part in our convention. Please help us to give them the best possible impression of our fandom!\n\n\n**REGISTRATION AND BADGES**\n  * You must be at least 18 years old on the first day of the convention.\n  * Eurofurence functions are open only to registered attendees.\n  * Attendees are identified by their personal membership badge.\n  * A badge is valid only for the person to whom it was issued and may not be shared.\n  * Badges must be presented and/or surrendered to any Staff member requesting it.\n  * Changing or obscuring information on your badge is not allowed.\n\n\n**HOTEL RULES**\n  * The consumption of food or drink purchased from outside of the hotel is not permitted in the hotel's public areas.\n  * It is strictly forbidden to throw/dangle/hang anything out of any windows, balconies or any other elevated location. Violators will be expelled from the convention.\n  * Attendees may not enter the service areas of the hotel. This includes all backstage areas, service elevators, the rooftops, emergency exits and all areas marked as \""Staff Only\"".\n  * Disabling or deliberately triggering fire-protection devices (such as smoke detectors, sprinklers, door alarms) is strictly prohibited.\n  * The sale of any kind of merchandise outside the official Dealers' Den requires explicit permission by the Eurofurence Board of Directors.\n  * No sleeping in the lobby, the hallways or the meeting rooms. Get a room, please!\n  * For safety reasons it is not allowed to bring dogs, cats or other animals into your hotel room or any of the convention event areas.\n\n\n**PARTIES AND GATHERINGS**\n  * Gatherings in hotel rooms must not generate any noise that can be heard in neighboring rooms during nighttime hours.\n  * Hotel doors must be kept shut during such gatherings and guests are not permitted to congregate in the hotel corridors.\n  * Loud parties will be given a single warning to remain quiet. No second warnings will be given before action is taken by the hotel to remove the offending individuals.\n  * All room occupants are equally responsible for cleaning up after a party. Trash must be put into bags. Don't leave the mess for hoursekeeping.\n  * Security is required to clear out overcrowded rooms. For your own safety we recommend keeping the occupancy below 10 in a regular room, or below 20 in a junior suite.\n\n\n**CLOTHING AND DECENCY**\n\nWearing costumes, accessories or displaying items made out of real fur is not allowed.\nNudity exceeding the equivalent of a non-thong bathing suit is not allowed in public.\nTo prevent damage to costumes and hotel property, body paint requires an individual permission by the Chief of Security. Face makeup does not require permission.\n\nSexual behaviour that goes beyond a mere display of affection is not allowed in public.\nBlatant exposure of fetish gear is not permitted in public, even if it is part of a costume.\nDisplay of adult materials (such as room signs, flyers, business cards, posters and drawings on public message boards) is not permitted in public areas of the hotel and convention center.\nThe limit for \""adult themed\"" materials is the equivalent of what you can see on the magazine covers at an average German newsstand. Drawing the line for \""fetish gear\"" is a little bit more tricky. To avoid unexpected differences with our Security Staff, please ask us in advance if you're unsure about the adequacy of an item.\nWhen used as a fashion statement or part of a costume, the following items are usually allowed:\n  * Collars (without leash)\n  * Decorative Wristbands (without D-Rings)\n  * Sled Dog Harnesses (only if part of a matching costume)\n\nThe following items are explicitly NOT allowed in public:\n  * Full-body rubber or vinyl costumes.\n  * Costumes that are visibly \""anatomically correct\"".\n  * Costumes or accessories related to age-play, pet-play or BDSM.\n  * Costumes indecently revealing the wearers own private anatomy.\n\nWe may take the liberty to allow additional exceptions if your outfit is exceptionally discrete, tasteful and/or good looking - no promise, though.\n\n\n**ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS**\n\nPersons who are intoxicated to the point of incapacity will be escorted to their room, and may consequentially be banned from the convention.\nAny individual found to be in possession of or distributing illegal or controlled substances will be removed and reported directly to the local authorities.\nSmoking is not permitted anywhere inside the hotel and convention center, except for the smoker's lounge.\nYou are expected to drink responsibly. You will be held responsible for what you do, even when drunk.\n\n\n**WEAPONS**\n\nAll weapons, including look-alikes, replicas, tools and toys must be approved immediately after your registration on site. Please go to the ConOps office for approval.\nSecurity may require your weapon to be peace-bound. Tampering with the peace bonding is not allowed.\nNo water pistols, silly string, or any thrown or projectile-type toy may be used in any area of the hotel or convention center.\nMock fights, swordplay, fire breathing or any other dangerous activities are not allowed.\nExceptions for staged events are possible, but require an individual permission by the Chief of Security. Please make sure to inquire ahead of time - perferably before the convention.\n\n\n**PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO**\n\nEurofurence e.V. reserves all rights to video and photo material gathered at the convention with the exception of footage from private rooms.\nEurofurence e.V. grants you the right to use videos and photos you have taken at the convention for private and/or non-commercial purposes.\nPublication in for-profit media requires written permission by the Board of Directors.\nOfficial Eurofurence camera teams may record video and take photos in the public areas of the convention and during events to be used for publication. You agree that videos and pictures taken of you can be used in such publications without release or compensation. A release will only be required for material filmed in situations where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.\nPhotography and filming is strictly forbidden in the Art Show. Cameras and cell phones will have to be left outside.\nOther restrictions or rules may apply for certain events, and will be announced on location.\n\n\n**THE BOTTOM LINE**\n\nThat being said, many of the above rules involve \""worst-case\"" scenarios and are put into place to ensure the safety and comfort of our members. In the past, Eurofurence has generally been a quiet and pleasurable experience, and we anticipate no difficulties, as our members as a whole are rational and responsible adults. Eurofurence is prepared to deal with any or all of the above scenarios in a rapid and efficient manner, should they occur. We thank our members for their past cooperation and for their continued assistance in making this a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.
